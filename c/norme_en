Foreword

This document describes the applicable standard (Norm) at 42. A programming standard
defines a set of rules to follow when writing code. You must always respect the Norm for
all C projects at the school, unless otherwise specified.


I.1     Why impose a standard?
The Norm’s two main objective : 1. To format and standardize your code so that anyone
(students, staff and even yourself) can read and understand them easily. 2. To guide you
in writing short and simple code.


I.2     The Norm for submissions
All of your C files must respect the school’s Norm. It will be checked by your grader. If
you made any Norm error you’ll get a 0 for the exercise or even for the whole project.
During peer-evaluations, your grader will have to launch the “Norminette” present in
your submission’s dumps. Only the mandatory part of the Norm will be checked by the
“Norminette”.


I.3     Suggestions
You’ll realise soon enough that the Norm isn’t as intimidating as it seems. On the
contrary, it’ll help you more than you know. It’ll allow you to read your classmates’ code
more easily and vice versa. A source file containing one Norm error will be treated the
same way as a source file containing 10 Norm errors. We strongly advise you to keep the
Norm in mind while coding - even though you may feel it’s slowing you down at first. In
time, it’ll become a reflex.


I.4     Disclaimers
“Norminette” is a program, and all programs are subject to bugs. Should you spot one,
please report it in the forum’s appropriate section. However, as the “Norminette” always
prevails, all your submissions must adapt to its bugs.

The Norm

II.1    Denomination
Mandatory part
  • A structure’s name must start by s_.

  • A typedef’s name must start by t_.

  • A union’s name must start by u_.

  • An enum’s name must start by e_.

  • A global’s name must start by g_.

  • Variables and functions names can only contain lowercases, digits and ’_’ (Unix
    Case).

  • Files and directories names can only contain lowercases, digits and ’_’ (Unix Case).

  • The file must compile.

  • Characters that aren’t part of the standard ascii table are forbidden.

Advice part
  • Objects (variables, functions, macros, types, files or directories) must have the most
    explicit or most mnemonic names as possible. Only ’counters’ can be named to your
    liking.

  • Abreviations are tolerated as long as it’s to shorten the original name, and that
    it remains intelligible. If the name contains more than one word, words shall be
    separated by ‘_’.

  • All identifiers (functions, macros, types, variables, etc) must be in English.

  • Any use of global variable must be justifiable.

                                           3
The Norm                                                                   Version 2.0.2


II.2    Formatting
Mandatory part
  • All your files must begin with the standard school header (from the first line of the
    file). This header is available by default with emacs and vim in the dumps.

  • You must indent your code with 4-space tabulations. This is not the same as 4
    average spaces, we’re talking about real tabulations here.

  • Each function must be maximum 25 lines, not counting the function’s own curly
    brackets.

  • Each line must be at most 80 columns wide, comments included. Warning : a
    tabulation doesn’t count as a column, but as the number of spaces it represents.

  • One instruction per line.

  • An empty line must be empty: no spaces or tabulations.

  • A line can never end with spaces or tabulations.

  • You need to start a new line after each curly bracket or end of control structure.

  • Unless it’s the end of a line, each comma or semi-colon must be followed by a space.

  • Each operator (binary or ternary) or operand must be separated by one - and only
    one - space.

  • Each C keyword must be followed by a space, except for keywords for types (such
    as int, char, float, etc.), as well as sizeof.

  • Each variable declaration must be indented on the same column.

  • The asterisks that go with pointers must be stuck to variable names.

  • One single variable declaration per line.

  • We cannot stick a declaration and an initialisation on the same line, except for
    global variables and static variables.

  • Declarations must be at the beginning of a function, and must be separated by an
    empty line.

  • There cannot be an empty line between declarations or implementations.

  • Multiple assignments are strictly forbidden.



                                           4
The Norm                                                                  Version 2.0.2


  • You may add a new line after an instruction or control structure, but you’ll have
    to add an indentation with brackets or affectation operator. Operators must be at
    the beginning of a line.


II.3    Functions parameters
Mandatory part
  • A function can take 4 named parameters maximum.

  • A function that doesn’t take arguments must be explicitely pototyped with the
    word "void" as argument.


II.4    Functions
Mandatory part
  • Parameters in functions’ prototypes must be named.

  • Each function must be separated from the next by an empty line.

  • You can’t declare more than 5 variables per bloc.

  • Return of a function has to be between parantheses.

Advice part
  • Your functions’ identifiers must be aligned within a same file. Same goes for header
    files.


II.5    Typedef, struct, enum and union
Mandatory Part
  • Add a tabulation when declaring a struct, enum or union.

  • When declaring a variable of type struct, enum or union, add a single space in the
    type.

  • Add a tabulation between two parameters of a typedef.

  • When declaring a struct, union or enum with a typedef, all rules apply. You must
    align the typedef’s name with the struct/union/enum’s name.

  • You cannot declare a structure in a .c file.

II.6    Headers
Mandatory Part
  • The things allowed in header files are : header inclusions (system or not), declara-
    tions, defines, prototypes and macros.

  • All includes (.c or .h) must be at the beginning of the file.

  • We’ll protect headers from double inclusions. If the file is ft_foo.h, its bystander
    macro is FT_FOO_H.

  • Functions’ prototypes must exculively be in .h files.

  • Unused header inclusions (.h) are forbidden.

Advice part
  • All header inclusions must be justified in a .c file as well as in a .h file.


II.7    Macros and Pre-processors
Mandatory part
  • Preprocessor constants (or #define) you create must be used only for associate
    literal and constant values.

  • All #define created to bypass the norm and/or obfuscate code are forbidden. This
    point must be checked by a human.

  • You can use macros available in standard libraries, only if those ones are allowed
    in the scope of the given project.

  • Multiline macros are forbidden.

  • Only macros names are uppercase.

  • You must indent characters following #if , #ifdef or #ifndef.


II.8    Forbidden stuff !
Mandatory part
  • You’re not allowed to use :

       ◦ for

       ◦ do...while


                                             6

        ◦ switch

        ◦ case

        ◦ goto

  • Nested ternary operators such as ‘?’.

  • VLAs - Variable Length Arrays.


II.9     Comments
Mandatory part
  • You’re allowed to comment your code in your source files.

  • Comments cannot be inside functions’ bodies.

  • Comments start and end by a single line. All intermediary lines must align and
    start by ‘**’.

  • No comments with //.

Advice part
  • You comments must be in English. And they must be useful.

  • A comment cannot justify a "bastard" function.


II.10      Files
Mandatory part
  • You cannot include a .c file.

  • You cannot have more than 5 function-definitions in a .c file.


II.11      Makefile
Mandatory part
  • The $(NAME), clean, fclean, re and all rules are mandatory.

  • If the makefile relinks, the project will be considered non-functional.

  • In the case of a multibinary project, on top of the rules we’ve seen, you must have a
    rule that compiles both binaries as well as a specific rule for each binary compiled.

  • In the case of a project that calls a functions library (e.g.: libft), your makefile
    must compile this library automatically.

  • All source files you need to compile your project must be explicitly named in your
    Makefile.
